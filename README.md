This is a set of simple scripts that helps to track the arbitrage opportunity between the South African Luno Bitcoin exchange, and the UK CEX.io exchange.

In general, when a premium opens up above 7-8% there is an arbitrage opportunity that can be easily executed by adding funds to CEX.io with a credit card, then selling the equivalent Bitcoin on Luno immediately. The Bitcoin transfer from CEX back to Luno can happen at a later date. Usually, the trade is worthwhile above 11% premium - this will compensate for fee and the time involved.

The code can be set up to send the user an email alert for a specific premium.
